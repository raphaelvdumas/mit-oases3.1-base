TESTING
-------

These instructions preassume that at this point, you've already done a
successful make from the top level directory.

Now, if everything has gone OK, there'll be a binary in the ./Bin directory
named "plotmtv".  To test this binary, type "run.sh" in this directory
   % cd ./Tests
   % run.sh
 
If you are unlucky, ./Tests/run.sh will refuse to run.  This happens on some
platforms, e.g dec/mips, probably because of shell incompatibilites.
If this happens, try running "run.csh" instead.
   % run.csh
