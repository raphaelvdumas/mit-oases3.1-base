>>>>> OASES Installation <<<<<

Run the following commands (or the included build.sh script):

  > mkdir build_dir # the build directory can be in any location you desire
  > cd build_dir
  > cmake ../       # replace '../' with the path to the Oases repository
                    # alternatively, for installation in a custom directory
                    #  add the cmake flag : -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=~/custom/
  > make
  > make install


OASES follows the FORTRAN-77 standard strictly.

gfortran is the supported compiler, although historically other compilers were too.


>>>>> Post-Installation Setup <<<<<

After compiling and linking succesfully, put the bin directory BIN you
have chosen into your PATH, and move all the command files shipped in
oases/bin to this directory as well. To add the OASES bin directory to
the path, use the statement (e.g. in your .cshrc file)

> setenv OASES_SH ${HOME}/Oases/bin
> setenv OASES_BIN ${HOME}/Oases/bin/${HOSTTYPE}-${OSTYPE}
> setenv OASES_LIB ${HOME}/Oases/lib/${HOSTTYPE}-${OSTYPE}
> set path = (OASES_SH OASES_BIN/$path)

If you are running under X-windows, answer x when MINDIS asks for
the terminal type, or you may set the environmental variable in your .login 
file:

> setenv USRTERMTYPE x

Also, you have the option of using  the default MINDIS plot
package which is included in the OASES export package, or the public
domain PLOTMTV graphics package. 

To use PLOTMTV for color contour plots, issue the command: 

> setenv CON_PACKGE MTV

Similarly to replace MINDIS with PLOTMTV for line plots, use the
command

> setenv PLP_PACKGE MTV  

Type rehash, and you are ready to go. You will find sample data files in 
Oases/tloss, Oases/pulse, and Oases/rcoef. 

The documentation for OASES is available as a supplement to the SAFARI
manual in LaTeX format in the file: Oases/doc/oases.tex

Good luck and have fun.
