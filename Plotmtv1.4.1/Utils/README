This directory contains programs to convert from the Berkeley contour,
pdraw and drawplot formats to the MTVDAT format used by plotmtv.

Usage:

   ctr2mtv [-b] [-o outfile] file1 file2 ...
   pdraw2mtv [-b] [-o outfile] file1 file2 ...
   drawplot2mtv [-b] [-o outfile] file1 file2 ...

   where 
     -b     forces output in a machine-dependent binary format.
            The data file created in this fashion cannot be edited manually.
            Also the data file cannot be read in on a different platform.
            By default, the programs write in ASCII format.

     -o outfile
            Specifies the name of the MTVDAT output file

     file1 file2...
            The names of the original data files.  Each program expects 
            data-files in specific formats, i.e. ctr2mtv expects contour
            formatted files.
