This is PLOTMTV V1.4.1, which adds probability plots, bar-charts and
histograms to version 1.3.2.  PLOTMTV V1.4.1 also includes
several minor bug-fixes to the 1.4.0 version.  

This version has been compiled on SPARC (SunOS 4.1.3) and IBM RS6K platforms.

CHANGES FROM VERSION 1.4.0
--------------------------
   * Added ability to scale annotations

   * Added command-line argument to delete datafiles just before quitting
     the program.

   * Fixed ./Plot/Imakefile.  The original version had spaces in one
     of the rules instead of a tab, which caused problems on SGI machines.

   * Fixed postscript scaling bug (a font specified using MTV_PSFONTX would
     change back to the default after zooming in/out.


CHANGES FROM VERSION 1.3.X
--------------------------

The major changes/additions are:

   * Support for probability plots, bar-charts and histograms.

   * Plot behavior has been changed from "create a new window for each plot" 
     to a single window with multiple pages (1 page per plot).  In this mode, 
     buttons are used to scroll between different pages.

   * Capability to see multiple plots in a single plot window has been
     added.  When invoked with "plotmtv -comb <files>", a single plot window
     with multiple frames are drawn.  This allows easier comparison of plots.

Minor changes are:

   * A new button to toggle between current and previous zoom states has 
     been added to PLOTMTV's 2D plot window.

   * The PostScript text font sizes can now be controlled via environment
     variables.

   * Added environment variable to disable ISOLatin font in PostScript.
     This font is not available on certain PS-Level 1 machines.

   * Axis labels have been improved, and the ability to define the
     axis-labels has been added.

   * Added "% axisguides" option to prevent drawing the small axis-guide gizmo
     in 3D plots.

   * Added "% boundary" flag for CURVE2D/CURVE3D datasets to enlarge the 
     default plot boundary 
 
   * Added "% sidelabel" and "% sidelabellength" flags to turn off the
     side-label annotations, and to control the size of the area for the
     side-label annotations.

   * Added "% innerticks", which provides the capability to do innerticks, 
     i.e. ticks are drawn on the inside of the plot, instead of the default 
     where half the ticks are drawn inside, and the other half are drawn 
     outside.

   * The default 3D view has been changed to left-handed world coordinates

   * -geom flag now works!  
     Also geometry can be read in from the Xdefaults file using
     "plotmtv.Geometry: +40+40"

   * -noframe flag added to disable the frame on a scaled-down Postscript plot.

   * Changes to make the SGI C compiler happy

   * Fixes to rubberbands for X86 platforms, PC-based UNIX

   * Fix to parser.c that fixes a "modify-constant-character-string" bug.

PLOTMTV V1.4.1 also comes with improved documentation (via FrameMaker)

HISTORY

PLOTMTV is based on the DRAWPLOT, CONTOUR and PDRAW programs from 
U.C. Berkeley (yes, I'm responsible for those too!). PLOTMTV essentially
combines all the capabilities of the three packages into one single package.

PLOTMTV was first released in March 1993 (Version 1.3.1).  Version 1.4.0 was
released in July 1994, while Version 1.4.1, the latest revision (this
release) was released in July 1995.

Footnote:
The MTV in PLOTMTV does not stand for Music TV.  It could stand for
Many Things Visualized, but does not.
