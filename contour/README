    These programs are using a DISSPLA compatible plotting 
    package developed at SACLANTCEN. In order for the programs 
    to be linked with the full DISSPLA package, a few
    modifications have to be made, however. 

    File CONTUR_M.CLK contains the commands used on
    a VAX installation to make an executable program using
    DISSPLA compatible code.

    It is also possible to get contour plots through UNIRAS
    software. If a UNIRAS library is available, then the commands
    for producing an executable program can be found in file
    CONTUR_U.CLK.

    This contour program accepts as input the output files
    produced by the propagation loss models PE, SAFARI, SNAP,
    and COUPLE.

    The commands used on a VAX installation to initiate a contour
    plot can be found in file CONTUR.COM
